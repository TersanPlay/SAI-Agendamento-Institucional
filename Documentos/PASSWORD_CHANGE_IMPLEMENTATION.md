# Password Change Implementation - EventoSys

## Problem Solved

Fixed the incorrect redirect to Django admin when users clicked "Alterar Senha" (Change Password) in the profile edit page. Previously, users were being redirected to `/admin/auth/user/1/password/` which required admin privileges.

## Solution Implemented

Created a complete password change functionality within the user profile system, allowing users to change their own passwords without requiring admin access.

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. **accounts/forms.py**
- Added import for `PasswordChangeForm` from Django auth
- Created `CustomPasswordChangeForm` class that extends Django's `PasswordChangeForm`
- Added proper CSS styling with Tailwind classes
- Added Portuguese labels and placeholders

### 2. **accounts/views.py** 
- Added import for `update_session_auth_hash` to prevent logout after password change
- Added import for `CustomPasswordChangeForm`
- Created `password_change_view` function that:
  - Handles GET and POST requests
  - Validates form data
  - Updates user password
  - Maintains user session after password change
  - Logs the action for audit purposes
  - Shows success/error messages

### 3. **accounts/urls.py**
- Added new URL pattern: `path('profile/password/', views.password_change_view, name='password_change')`

### 4. **templates/accounts/password_change.html** (NEW)
- Created complete password change template with:
  - Professional UI with Tailwind CSS
  - Security guidelines section
  - Password strength requirements
  - Toggle password visibility functionality
  - Form validation error display
  - Navigation back to profile
  - Security tips section

### 5. **templates/accounts/profile_edit.html**
- Fixed the "Alterar Senha" button link from Django admin URL to our custom URL
- Updated security section description to reflect self-service capability
- Added lock icon to the password change button

### 6. **templates/accounts/profile.html**
- Added "Alterar Senha" as a quick action button in the profile overview
- Positioned alongside other profile actions for easy access

- ✅ CSRF protection

### UI/UX Features
- ✅ Professional, responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## User Flow

1. **Access**: User goes to Profile → Click "Alterar Senha" button
2. **Authentication**: System shows password change form
3. **Validation**: User enters current password + new password (twice)
4. **Security Check**: Django validates password requirements
5. **Update**: Password is changed and session maintained
6. **Confirmation**: Success message shown, user redirected to profile
7. **Audit**: Action logged for security audit

## URLs Added

- `/accounts/profile/password/` - Password change form and processing

## Testing

✅ **Form Import Test**: Custom form loads correctly with proper styling
✅ **URL Resolution Test**: All URLs resolve correctly
✅ **Django Check**: No configuration issues detected
✅ **Server Start**: Runs without errors

## Security Considerations

- Users can only change their own passwords (login required)
- Current password verification prevents unauthorized changes
- Password strength validation enforced
- All actions logged for audit trail
- No sensitive information exposed in URLs or forms
- Session security maintained after password change

## Benefits

1. **User Independence**: Users no longer need admin help to change passwords
2. **Security Improvement**: Self-service password changes encourage regular updates
3. **Better UX**: Integrated experience within profile system
4. **Audit Compliance**: All password changes are logged
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
6. **Consistent Interface**: Matches application design patterns

The implementation successfully resolves the original issue while providing a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly password change system.
